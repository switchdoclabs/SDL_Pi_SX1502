Version 1.1 August 3, 2015

This board is an inexpensive I2C GPIO Extender Board. It allows you to add 8 pins of GPIO, with interrupts allowed on all pins, to any Arduino or Raspberry Pi design. It works with 5V and 3.3V and in fact you can have 4 pins at 5.0V while having 4 pins at 3.3V at the same time. It is based upon the Semtech SX1502.
